### Abstract  

Weather forecasting is a significant sector today that utilizes science and technology to forecast the conditions of the environment for a given area and time. Weather conditions affect people's everyday life, especially the aviation sector. Quantitative data about the current weather conditions of a given location and meteorology tools are used for weather forecasting in order to predict the changes in the atmosphere. This project aims to predict next-day rain by training classification models with as high accuracy as possible. While doing this project, we are going to implement machine learning algorithms to predict the weather condition (rainy or not) of Australia; namely k-nearest neighbor, Naive - Bayes and random forest algorithms. In this process, data that was retrieved from Kaggle will be used. The dataset is both cross - sectional and time - series data consisting of 10 years of daily weather observations from many different locations across Australia.

### Problem Understanding via CRISP-DM

In this project, we will perform data preprocessing, data visualization and three different machine learning algorithms which are k-Nearest Neighbor, Naïve Bayes and Random Forest. Our objective in the project is finding whether tomorrow is going to be rainy or not. Therefore, the target variable in the dataset is “Rain Tomorrow”. Since we have a target variable, we used supervised machine learning algorithms. In the data processing part, data was prepared for the implementation of the machine learning algorithm. Therefore, each of the models required different types of data pre-processing.
